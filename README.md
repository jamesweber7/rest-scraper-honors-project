This was an honors project with my Distributed Software Development professor in Spring 2023.


This is a C# program with three components:
1. A REST API to scrape yahoo finance and return JSON formatted data about selected stocks based on their ticker symbols.
2. A REST API which does the above but returns XML formatted data.
3. A program to call the two REST APIs and display the results with an ASPX web form.


Note that this uses yahoo finance's HTML from when the project was done, and ~~may not~~ *almost certainly will not* work properly with updates to yahoo finance's layout.
